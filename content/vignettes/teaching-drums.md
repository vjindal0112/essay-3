I rang the doorbell to the house with a big speaker in my hands. Nick came running down the stairs while his mom came to the door. Nick was wearing one of my t-shirts I had given him when it had gotten too small for me. It seemed like every time I came over he was wearing one of my shirts. His mom opened the door. "Hi Varun! How are you?! And whatcha got there?" She leaned back as she said it in her own Mrs. Stuven way.

I smiled. "Hi Mrs. Stuven! Things have been pretty good, school is in full session for sure. Hoping to play along with some music today."

I walked up the stairs with Nick to his room. "What's up Nick! How was school this week?"

"It was good." He responded with the classic 3 word answer that most 7th graders respond with. We walked up to his room where there was a drumset in the left corner. It was my old drum set that Santa had gotten Nick for Christmas. Strewn across the room were his action figures and Transformers. He was a big Optimus Prime fan like me. In the middle the drum pad was set up with a music stand in front of it.

For the past month or so, I had been teaching Nick to play drums. He had started percussion as his instrument in school in fourth grade, and every so often I would help him out at concerts by standing with him to play notes with him. But, recently he had started middle school and needed some extra help with the music. He has William's syndrome which gives him a slight disadvantage when it comes to learning and reading. I had been trying to help him learn, but nothing had worked so far.

I set down the speaker right next to the electrical outlet on my left and plugged it in.

"Nick, we're going to try something different today. I know it's been tough to read notes for the past few weeks, so let's try to just listen. Let's try out the drum set instead of the plastic drum pad."

Nick looked up at me in surprise, "Really, are you sure?" He hesitantly sat down at the drum set.

"Yeah, definitely. Try to hear the beat and hit the snare drum when I clap."

I began to play "Happy" by Pharrell Williams and turned up the volume to a blast.

Nick laughed, "This is my favorite song!"

I began clapping with the song and Nick was playing along, both of us grinning.
