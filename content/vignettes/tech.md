I walked into the hallway to witness a huge line that led to four tables lined up next to each other. At each of the tables were four or five people greeting people, checking the roster, and handing out admission bands. I tried to find the end of the line and stood there.

"Hey, is this the line for PennApps?"

"It sure is."

Cool, I made it. This was the first time I had taken trains and busses by myself to cross multiple states. I was at one of the biggest hackathons in the United States, and it was wild. The dull roar of people excitedly talking to one another was everywhere. Most were college kids. Dang, what was I doing here?

I waited in line for a while and finally made it to the front where I got my admission band for food. I had texted the people I had met over facebook, they were already in a room somewhere. I walked in to meet them for the first time in person.

"Hey Matt, hey Rohit!"

"Hello hello, what's up!"

We had made a team in the hackathon's facebook group, it was a team of 4 from New York, California, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. It felt amazing.

As the hackathon progressed, I roamed around to all the other hundreds of rooms with people furiously typing to finish their vision for their projects. Just asking what people were working on was inspiring, I saw teams working to detect forest fires early with computer vision, creating desktop screens out of paper, and innovating on an idea to detect a disease with just a saliva sample. I had no idea that computer science could be used for so much good.

Well that's cool, now I like computer science. This was the same narrative I talked about in my college apps. But, how did I even get there in the first place?

If interests are created by exposure to ideas, then what if I was just exposed to computer science in the most favorable way? What if I was pushed towards computer science because I saw my dad and others working at tech companies when I was younger? Are my interests developed or intrinsic?

An interest that is intrinsic would be one that I know when I see. As soon as I was exposed to it, I would have fallen in love with it. But, that wasn't the case for me with computer science. When my parents put me in technology summer camps when I was younger, I don't think I liked it very much. I thought coding was confusing and boring. But, I saw that people did cool stuff with it and thought how could I possibly do that? But, as I grew older, I began to dislike humanities and did more math and science.

I was good at math, I think that's why I liked it. It was something that I would get praise for. Perhaps it created a feedback loop in my head, I am pretty good at math, I do well at math, I get praise, I do more math, I get better at math, I get praise and so on and so forth. Maybe that interest developed like that, then my brain began to optimize to learn math.

As I got older, since I was predisposed to math, I began doing more math related things like engineering and computer science. Liking computer science was a simple jump. Now I legitimately enjoy it.

That doesn't sound intrinsic. But, it all started with me liking math. Was that intrinsic? Perhaps people are predisposed to certain things, sparking initial interest in a fundamental topic like math, science, history, or language.

If that's the case, then why are most people unhappy with their job? There is certainly inequality of opportunity at play here. That's a confounding factor that makes it really hard to see whether interest is intrinsic.

Maybe I followed the path I was meant to. Who knows?
