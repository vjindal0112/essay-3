I checked my phone. It was Mr. Balsamo, my drum teacher for the past 8 years. He sent me a text saying that he was sick and would have to cancel drum practice. It was only 2 hours before class. That's pretty odd, he's never canceled class. Everyone gets sick, it's probably fine. 

The next month went by as normal. One day, after sitting on the couch in Mr. Balsamo's basement, waiting for the student before me to finish, I walked into the drum room with two drum sets. One for me, the student, and one for Mr. Balsamo. This is where Mr. Balsamo had all of his lessons. The walls of the room were covered in cork boards, and these cork boards were covered in posters of famous musicians from all over the world. I sat down into the familiar seat and we began chatting casually. As usual, Mr. Balsamo cared deeply about what had happened over the week we had not talked, and asked me questions. I would also take the chance to ask Mr. Balsamo about the cool things he had done the past week. This time, however, he told me something I didn't expect.

"Varun, I have cancer. Those trips to the city I've been taking were to Sloan Kettering."

For a while I had suspected something was up, but I didn't really expect this.
"It's really an amazing place, the technology they possess is incredible. They are working on this special immunotherapy medicine that I'm trying out."
Forever the optimist, Mr. Balsamo began explaining the experimental immunotherapy medicine they were working on with him. I still hadn't said anything. Mr. Balsamo seemed to play his cancer off as something that was just a fact of existence. It just is, that's it. 

"How has chemotherapy been?" These were my first words.

Mr. Balsamo explained it all to me and we continued with the lesson. Afterwards, to my surprise, not much actually changed. Mr. Balsamo didn't want to be defined by cancer, he continued to define himself by his character. I would ask him every lesson how he was doing, and that was the only time he would talk about it. He wouldn't hide it nor deny it, but he also didn't make it his life. Only he could strike such a great balance. 

A few months later, my graduation party was coming up and I invited a few of my key mentors in my life. Mr. Balsamo was one of them. 

He came up to speak in front of everyone at my graduation party. He was entirely calm, collected, and strong â€” as I'd always known him. He called me up to stand beside him, and with his arm wrapped around my shoulders he talked about his role as an educator, the traits he saw in me, and the gratitude that he had every time I came in to ask how he was feeling. He described how I would listen to all of his stories of his trips to New York City, good and bad. He talked about how proud he was to see me come to where I was. I looked at him and simply couldn't imagine that with all the odds stacked against him, he still found gratitude in the small, almost insignificant, support that I had provided him. This was the point I couldn't hold back. I I cried in front of everyone I had ever known in my community. I hadn't cried for over 5 years.

The intense gratitude I had for my family, my mentors, and my friends poured out of me at that moment. I looked around at everyone through my tears and had a moment of humbling at the incredible privilege I possessed in being surrounded by them.
